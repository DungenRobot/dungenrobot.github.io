Howdy ya'll, I have two big announcements to share!

First: Theme voting for The Jam 2 is [out now!](https://forms.gle/XzJWG9rTFuoyrpKBA)

But before that... I now have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/YUECSUHHM8)

Theme announcements and minor updates will be moving there, this *should* free up my blog to be more strictly about my game projects. A showcase of all submissions will still be put up as a blog post.

If you'd also like notifications for when I release a new blog post or game, that's the place to be.

That's all for this post! I hope you enjoy the selection of themes.
