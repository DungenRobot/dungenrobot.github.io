## Seagulls don’t you’re half eaten Mars bar

I live in a small town and work on an old WWII runway where we dry seaweed for use in various products (kind of weird, I know). I am a bycatch analyst, and I spend all day digging through the seaweed to ensure that our harvesters do their jobs and do not catch anything they shouldn't. As part of my job, I have gotten to know the seagulls well and enjoy photographing them on slow days. I have come to learn some things about the seagulls, like they love blueberries and crabs but if you offer them half of your half eaten mars bar they will become offended. Don’t worry though they will still sit and let you talk to them well you work because they know your going crazy alone out there.
