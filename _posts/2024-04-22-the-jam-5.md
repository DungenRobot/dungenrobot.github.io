## The Brighter the Star, the Darker the Shadow

![painting of a person on stage. all spotlights are on them.](/assets/jam/5/BrighterStart-DarkerShadow.jpeg)

Medium: Alcohol Marker and White Pen. The drama of an eclipse undeniably comes from the drastic contrast between the light of the sun and the dark space when it is obscured. Similarly, celebrities and performers provide audiences with bright and stunning performances. Yet, the brighter they shine, the more likely something is being sacrificed or hidden. This is the dark space of living life under the bright lights. The white marks on the shadow here are inspired by the strange wavy and crescent shaped shadows that appeared during the eclipse, mimicking that strange, uncanny feeling that the eclipse brings.

## Blooming Eclipse

My interpretation of an eclipse, with the moon and her lover, the sun, who she is partially covering much like a true eclipse.

That's it for this jam! Finals are here so I'll be going dark for a couple weeks, but The Jam will return over this summer! I'm hoping we can outdo last year's jam in number of submissions.

If you want to stay up to date with that: [join the discord](https://discord.com/invite/YUECSUHHM8)! You can get notifications for The Jam and everything else I do online.

That's it for now, stay creative!
