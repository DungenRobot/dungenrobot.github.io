About a month ago I hosted a jam for myself and some friends of mine. Anyone could suggest and vote on the theme. Once a theme was selected, everyone would have ten days to submit *something* based around it.

The Jam's theme was "**Sun and Moon**"

The entries are in order of submission. Those who submitted earlier appear close to the top.

## "Sightless Stars"

What of the tale of twin lovers,\
Who dance through the ages unknown?\
Their celestial dance uncovers\
The world we call our own.\
He, the impossible ball of cosmic fire,\
King who incinerates evil with ease.\
She, the globe that reflects a forgotten desire,\
Amnesiac queen who governs the seas.\
Together, they are on a mission.\
To create something greater than they\
Is the noblest ambition,\
Despite what sightless stars may say.

## "Cyber City"

A futuristic city that is controlled by day and chaotic by night.

## "Opposite sides"

Just a pixel art drawing you can look at two ways- But it's sideways and I can't figure out how to fix it :,)

## "Aperture"

A simple drawing I made based on the relevant prompt that was given to me, and as you'd be able to fairly easily tell from the drawing, I was quite literal with my approach.
