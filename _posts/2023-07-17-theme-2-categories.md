    <b> Lullaby to Soil</b> by The Altruist<br>

    As I walk through the rows of the dead,
    Each corpse peeks out of the ground with their stone head.<br>
        Every one had a story, I trust.<br>
        The detritus and dust<br>
    Carries stories untold, plans unschemed.<br>
    This is what it means, to walk among the soil that once dreamed.<br><br>

    We focus on placing one foot in front of the other.<br>
        Because we fear that without the stride, we would just slumber beneath the grass.<br>
    Alas, your mortality you cannot smother.<br>
        Your bones will break and into the past you will pass.<br>
    All the same, journey, journey, until you die.<br>
    So you may sleep, dearest soil, with your headstone held high.<br>

Congrats to all the winners! Like the winners of the last jam, your trophies will not be sent to you as they do not exist.

That's all for this post! Sorry for the lack of dev-logs, I'm on vacation with a super underpowered laptop as my only computer. It's drawing out development time but it's also forcing me to worry a *lot* more about optimizing this project. As always, if you haven't already: [head over to my discord]() to participate in future jams! See ya'll soon!
