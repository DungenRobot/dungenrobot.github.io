Congrats to all the winners! Like the winners of the last jam, your trophies will not be sent to you as they do not exist.

That's all for this post! Sorry for the lack of dev-logs, I'm on vacation with a super underpowered laptop as my only computer. It's drawing out development time but it's also forcing me to worry a *lot* more about optimizing this project. As always, if you haven't already: [head over to my discord]() to participate in future jams! See ya'll soon!
