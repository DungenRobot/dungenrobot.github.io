We've got stars, but they don't look great close-up. And what about planets anyway?

This is the second devlog in my journey to make a space game! To learn about how we're storing position and rendering the starfield, check out [my last devlog](/null-op/devlog/1)

# Another Interlude

Before we dive straight in, let's talk about randomization again (I know, I'm *super* fun at parties). Our last method looked something like this. Can you spot the problem? (I didn't at the time)

```
func StarNG(cell_position: Vector3i) -> Vector3:
    var rand = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
    var noise = FastNoiseLite.new()

    # fixed seeding algorithm 
    rand.set_seed(cell_position.x)
    rand.set_seed(cell_position.y + rand.randi())
    rand.set_seed(cell_position.z + rand.randi())

    #generates an offset
    var vector_out = Vector3()
    vector_out.x = rand.randf_range(-1, 1)
    vector_out.y = rand.randf_range(-1, 1)
    vector_out.z = rand.randf_range(-1, 1)

    return vector_out
```

We're making another assumption here. We're assuming that this RNG is *cascading*, meaning that if we change the seed even just *slightly*, we'll get completely different numbers. This isn't the case, and the documentation clearly states it.

```
Note: The RNG does not have an avalanche effect, and can output similar random streams given similar seeds. Consider using a hash function to improve your seed quality if they're sourced externally.
```

Hash functions are a bit beyond this blog, but they do one thing that's very helpful for us: If you change the input even slightly, the entire output changes. Godot's hash function also takes in any type and spits out an integers, which is perfect for our use case.

```
# hashed seeding algorithm 
rand.set_seed(hash(cell_position))
```

Oops! Our performance is shit again.

Hash functions are great, but they're not fast to compute. To fix this, we can add our stars to a list when we move them, and work through the list at a slower pace to help our performance.

# Adding Close-Up Stars

Our stars look nice in big images like this:

But as soon as we get too close...

![ugly awful star](/assets/devlog/null-op/1/bad-stars-close.png)

We can see our terrible little texture. 

An easy fix is to make this texture a big higher res, but that's only a temporary fix. If we want to be able to zoom around these stars in our ship, we should use a 3d model of our stars.


Firstly: How are we even rendering this stuff? 


The answer is layers! We can break up objects by distance. Like I mentioned previously, we can't have stuff too far away from our origin or we'll run into issues. So we can cheat our distances a bit with our layers.

![layer example](/assets/devlog/null-op/1/layer-example.png)

The back layer holds our starfield. These stars are super low detail, and are actually pretty close to our camera (within 5 meters). The next layer holds some higher-detail stars. Because we're only processing nearby stars, we need fewer of them and we can render them with greater distances (a few thousand meters wide). This is the layer we'll be creating today. The next layer will be for close-up objects like space stations or other players.

We store the player's position in a global node that every other node can access. Each of these layers is processed with a separate conversion factor to represent their scale.

![there are quite a few of these](/assets/devlog/null-op/1/constants.png)

The layers are rendered with a `transparent background`. This lets us stack them to create our final view. 



Let's add glow! Glow is a pretty cheap way we can make objects appear brighter or more impressive than they actually are. We can add glow to our scene using a WorldEnvironment Node. 

But what's this? Where's our glow? 

As it happens, a variety of post-processing effects (such as glow), currently do not with with transparent backgrounds. 

## The fix:

We can actually apply our glow *after* we combine all our layers. Unfortunately, *glow is also a bit broken in 2D*. There's a couple extra steps we have to do before we can enable glow. (feel free to skip the next paragraph)

First we add a World Enviroment node to our 2d scene. Then we add an environment and enable glow. Next we have to make sure our background mode is set to `Canvas`. Our glow blend mode must be some value other than `Softlight`. Then we have to set bloom to a value greater than zero. 

Typically, glow is calculated using `HDR`. Normally our color values are within a range of 0 and 1, but on renderers that support HDR, we can set color values above this threshold. Glow typically begins once a color value goes beyond it's normal threshold, but Godot's 2D renderer currently doesn't support HDR. This is why we have to jump through a couple hoops for our 2D glow effect. This also means that anything on screen has a minor glow to it. This isn't fantastic but it's fine for now.
