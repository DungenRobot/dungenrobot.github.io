I'll be at GDC this week listening to talks and meeting people!
I'm super excited for a chance to engage with game dev types in person, and to hopefully show off what I've been working on behind the scenes.

If you'll be at GDC, reach out! You can contact me at [howdy@dungenrobot.com](mailto:howdy@dungenrobot.com) or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YUECSUHHM8).
If you can't make to to GDC, I've heard great things about [notgdc](https://notgdc.io/).
