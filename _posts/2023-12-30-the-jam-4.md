It's that time once more! Let's take a look at all the fantastic entries.

## The Invincible Fool
There is wisdom in idiocy:

The dunce dances with a pack on his back\
And a pale rose in his palm,\
Utterly oblivious to the fear he should feel.

Buffoons shall blunder and all fools must fall,\
But the falls always come lighter\
To the morons unfettered.\
\- The Altruist

## Death 13

I spent way too long on this goddamn mountain. Partially because of image splicing and partially because I kept wiki-diving for mountain lore. Ever hear about the Everest Crown of Death?

A tale of deception, graciousness, all under the light of the moon. Never ask questions you donâ€™t want to know, especially during the witching hour.
