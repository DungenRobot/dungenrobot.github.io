Hi! I'm DungenRobot and I code stuff. I occasionally also make stuff for other people, usually datapacks and tools for streamed events. This document outlines how my commissions work and how I format them. 

First off you should know whether I'm the right person to solve your problem. My previous commissions are listed elsewhere, but feel free to check out my games and code if that's more what you have in mind. If you're unsure or on the fence on whether I'd be able to tackle what you need, just reach out and we can discuss. In the past I've been asked to make Minecraft datapacks and resource packs and stream overlays.

## Phase 1: You have a project for me (am I even the right person for the job?)

This can be an idea you had for a Minecraft minigame, SMP, or just a problem you need to solve for your event. Let's tackle ideas first:

### You have a great idea 
But as great as your idea is, I can't make it until you tell me what you want. Let's have a conversation about roughly what you want and in what format.

### You have a problem you need solved
For a few events I've been asked to find a way to solve a certain problem. e.g. preventing players from using nether portals (without disabling the nether). In these cases I can aid in design more and talk through different solutions with you.

During this phase I'll talk to you about the scope of your project, how soon you need it finished, and I’ll let you know if this is something I can tackle for you. Consider this stage a free consultation about your project with no expectation that you’ll end up hiring me for it.

## Phase 2: Draft a spec

A specification is a detailed precise presentation of something or of a plan or proposal for something (merriam-webster)
This phase isn’t strictly necessary for me to complete a project, but a document like this helps us both stay on the same page. I don’t want to be asking for payment for a final product that you aren’t happy with.

Be as specific and precise as you can be at this point. Include images and examples, if you can. Sketches help a whole lot here. 

## Phase 2.5: Spec Revisions

If there’s anything that stands out to me as a mistake or not specific enough, I’ll ask you to revise the document. I want to be clear that I am not going to edit this document myself. Every change made to it should be by you.

If you have multiple ideas for how something should work, include all of them and which you want to try first.

Based on this spec I should be able to give you a rough idea of how long the project should take me and around what the final total will be.

The following phases are 3 rounds of builds and feedback. 

Feedback can come in three forms:
1. My build doesn’t conform to your spec.
2. There’s a bug you found while testing
3. You don’t like something / you would like to change the spec

In the latter two cases we’ll discuss and then move on to the next phase.
In the case that something in my build doesn’t follow what you’ve outlined in your spec and I agree, we can repeat a phase. In this case you’ll get an extra round of builds and feedback.
I want to be clear that I have to agree that my build doesn’t match your spec. If your spec was unclear or doesn’t make sense, that is not a reason for repeating a phase. 

## Phase 3: Build 1

I’ll build out the core of what your project needs, without most of the visuals. This first build will functionally work but might lack visual polish or be tedious to use.

> A note on builds: 
> Development builds might include lockout features unless you’re paying a portion up front.  These features are to prevent a malicious person attempting to use the builds for more than testing.

## Phase 3.5: Feedback

At this point you as a client will provide feedback on the build. Be as exhaustive as possible. Err on the side of providing too much feedback rather than too little. Make sure to test the build too. I do my own testing during development but I miss details and don’t have the capacity to test certain multiplayer features.

Phase 4: Build 2

This build will be in a mostly complete state. Features may be lacking polish but should be close to their final forms. At this stage visuals will be in place. 

Phases 4.5: Feedback

Feedback in general is the same. Provide as much as you can. Tell me what the project needs in order to be complete. Criticize everything. This is the last phase where you can change the spec. After this phase the visual and mechanics cannot be drastically changed.

Phases 5 - 6: Builds 3 and 4

These builds are the last builds you can provide feedback on. They are going to be in a finalized state. At this point the only feedback should be around bugs and polish.

## Phase 7: Final Build

Once I’ve received payment and you’ve received the final version of your project, I can no longer provide bug fixes or changes. 

If you’d feel more comfortable having me on standby for your event, let me know in advance. This way I can price everything out to account for my time and schedule myself to make your event. In this case I can provide patches and quick fixes if you run into any issues.


Phase 8: Extra builds and features 

If during development you want to add features or otherwise expand the scope of the project, we can head back to phase 1 and start again. Please keep in mind that you will be charged for all the phases of development and this may greatly increase price.

If after the project is complete you’d like to add to it, we can start at phase 1 again. There charge for this project should be lesser given that I’ll be extending rather than building from scratch.

If you’d like extra rounds of development not covered by this document, I will be adding the charges to your final total.

## Payments

Expect to pay over $100 for anything that takes me more than a day. Projects on a tight deadline or where you want support after receiving a final build will be more expensive.
